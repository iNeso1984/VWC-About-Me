                <p><strong>The visual arts has always been a part of my background. I have 
                  been painting and drawing for over six years and have appeared 
                   in exhibitions throughout the United States. I am
                  passionate about designing websites that are attractive and
                   user-friendly. I decided to enter into the world of web 
                 development and coding in order to use what I have learned as a visual artists
                 with a military background and a background in science to explore new design concepts,
                 such as graphic design, animation, and virtual reality. I am currently 
                 studying web design at Sessions College for Professional Design. 
                 My goal is to become a Full-Stack Web Developer and Designer
                 in order to create dynamic websites that are visually compelling
                 for the user, whether the user is shopping or browsing a company's website.
